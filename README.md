<h1><i>_malloc</i> is my original malloc.</h1>
I started this project because I wanted to learn what happens exactly when I use malloc function.
In this library you can use:<br>
- <i>_malloc</i>(allocates memory for the bytes passed as arguments)<br>
- <i>_free</i>(free the memory at the address passed as an argument)<br>
- <i>_calloc</i>(allocate a specified amount of memory and then initialize it to zero)<br>
